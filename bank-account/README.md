# Java Bank Account Project

## Hi there! 

## Summary of this project 

It simulates an account transaction. An user can access accounts and give some API requests like deposit, withdraw, transfer between accounts, view all accounts, get an account by Id, and so on. 
I'll keep improving this project by adding new features and implementing new concepts. 
Suggestions to improve this code will be much appreciated =D

## How to use it

Any doubts just ask. You can use the tools that you want, in this case I used
both Postman and Swagger/OpenAPI. The home page in default is localhost:8080 .
To change it, go to the application.properties in the src/main/resources in
this project and type/change to server.port=numberOfThePort . 
To access the Swagger page just type in the browser: localhost:8080/swagger-ui/ when running the project.

## Which tools are being used

Currently using Java version 17, Spring Boot, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA
(Spring implementation), H2 database, Maven management build tool, JUnit for testing,
Swagger/OpenAPI and other frameworks and libraries.
